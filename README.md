# PoE-MapTool
Hover a map in PoE and press Ctrl-F to check it.

It will give you some information about the map (Layout, Tier, Boss, Mavenproblems, Recipes you can find, Soul to Capture with a Divine Vessel)
It will also warn you about some mods that are often a problem (Reflect, No Regen, Multi-Damage Mods, ...)

It's still work in progress, so not every map has all info yet.
